Congestion Control Strategy:

We used Cumulative ACK where the acknum sent by the server is the same as the sequence number the server is expecting next. AIMD was implemented using a congestion window no larger than the WINDOW_SIZE macro. Slow start was implemented when the current window size was below a hard-coded threshold. When the window size exceeded this threshold, congestion avoidance (additive increase) was used. If 3 or more duplicate ACKs occured, we used fast retransmit and fast recovery to handle this using a selective repeat approach. Also, we implemented timers for each transmitted packet. If a packet didn't receive an ACK addressing it for the amount of time specified for a timeout, the client would run a hard timeout where the window size goes down to 1 and retransmits the packet that timed out. If there were more than 3 duplicate ACKs before a timeout, we run fast recovery if (# duplicate ACKs % 3) is not 0 and we run fast retransmit again if otherwise. We did this to avoid hard timeouts at all costs.
