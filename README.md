# Reliable Data Transfer Protocol with Congestion Control

The project implements a reliable transfer protocol on top of UDP using congestion control strategies inspired by TCP.

## Strategy
Cumulative ACK is implemented such that the acknum sent by the server is the same as the sequence number the server is expecting next. AIMD is implemented using a congestion window no larger than the WINDOW_SIZE macro defined in `utils.h`. The Slow Start netowrking approach is activated when the current window size is below a hard-coded threshold `ssthresh`. When the window size exceeds this threshold, congestion avoidance (additive increase) is used. If 3 or more duplicate ACKs occur, fast retransmit and fast recovery is used to handle this following a selective repeat approach. Also, timers for each transmitting packet are implemented. If a packet doesn't receive an ACK addressing it for the amount of time specified for a timeout, the client runs a hard timeout where the window size goes to 1 and retransmits the packet that timed out. If there were more than 3 duplicate ACKs before a timeout, if (# duplicate ACKs % 3) is not 0, fast recovery is run and otherwise, fast retransmit is repeated. The aim of this strategy is to avoid hard timeouts to increase protocol efficiency.
